                    Hello! My name is Euginius Makaya and I am from Harare, Zimbabwe. I enjoy front end web development, design, art, photography, film, and music. I am a PathwayConnect missionary and a student. I am taking this course because I love web design. I want to improve on what I know so far. In this class I want to get the necessary tools that can help me create amaizing websites. And as I get exposed to the curated content of this course and recommended tools I will learn more than what I know now. And at the end become a web nerd. I will help others in this class learn what I would have learned so that we can all be edified.
