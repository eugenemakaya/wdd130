                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <p>
                        We started with one rafting boat and two guides that would go down to the river and have fun with their friends and relatives in the hot afternoons of the victorian sun. Because there were doing this with their friends and relatives they would make noise together as they enjoyed the adrenaline inducing experience. This became popular and our enthusiastic guides became famous and synonymous with great expeditions. We then had many tourists book to have the same experience.

                    <p class="second-paragraph">
                        We had to look for more rafting boats to cover all these bookings. And then we realized that it was the enthusiastic approach to rafting that created this new hype and it needed to be cascaded down to the new guides that we were training. And to achieve this we had to take them through this experiece for months so they would do the same with their clients. That‚Äôs how this culture of adrenalin junkie guide began. It has infected all our team and we are proud of our culture. This is what we share with our tourists.
